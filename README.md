# GridAware ‚Äì Smart EV Charging Dashboard

**Developed by Vaijayanth Sheri | MIT License**

GridAware is a modern, intelligent web dashboard that empowers Electric Vehicle (EV) owners in Germany to make cost-optimal charging decisions using real-time electricity prices. By integrating the Awattar market API, GridAware delivers actionable, transparent insights, enabling users to maximize savings, efficiency, and confidence in their energy decisions.

This application is built with a focus on user control, data transparency, and professional-level accuracy.

### **Core Features**

*   **Live Market Prices:** On-demand fetching of hourly electricity prices from the Awattar Germany API. Data is never fetched automatically, giving the user full control.
*   **Data Visualization:** A clear, interactive bar chart displays the current and upcoming hourly prices (‚Ç¨/kWh), with full transparency on data source and update times.
*   **EV Charging Optimization:** A comprehensive configuration form allows users to specify their vehicle, battery state, charging preferences, and constraints.
*   **Smart Recommendation Engine:** Calculates the optimal charging start time to achieve the desired state of charge at the lowest possible cost, considering all user-defined parameters.
*   **Clear Results & Insights:** A detailed summary card, visual overlay on the price chart, and cost breakdown provide unambiguous, actionable recommendations.
*   **Persistent State:** Your EV configuration is saved within your browser session, so you don't have to re-enter it every time.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The UI provides clear feedback for all states, including loading, successful fetches, API errors, or incomplete configurations.
